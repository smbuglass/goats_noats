Bastard daughter of [[The Nameless Yagi]]. Because her father did not claim her or make any attempt to be a part of her life, she has lived her life entirely as a peasant in [[Hiezu]].
# Disgraced Daidoji
Junko learned all she knows of combat from an elderly wandering ronin who met her while passing through [[Hiezu]]. A former member of the Daidoji Harriers, the ronin saw some promise in her, and perhaps a bit of Daidoji cunning inherited from her father, and decided to train her.

Though she lacked any of the elegance or refinement of her father, she proved to be good pupil, and the ronin reccomended she take the exam to become a [[Sapphire Magistrates|Sapphire Magistrate]].
