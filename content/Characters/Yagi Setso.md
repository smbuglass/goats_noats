One of [[Yagi Itsuko]] and [[Yagi Tetsuo]]'s children, was raised by the Crab after Tetsuo fell in a duel against the Crab's champion. A player character in Season 2 played by Ethan!
# Gaijin Culture
Setso is fascinated with Gaijin culture and makes it a point to collect and curios or artifacts he can get his hands on. He currently has an Urumi, or whip sword, which I'm sure he won't cut his own arm off with whenever he gets around to using it.
# Opium
Setso has a healthy appreciation for opium and this will surely not cause him any problems in the future. He can stop whenever he wants, but why would he when opium is so rad.
