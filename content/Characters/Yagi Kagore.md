Secondborn son of [[Yagi Taka]] and [[Yagi Tsetseg]].
# Child of Chikushido
During a critical moment in the events of season one, when The Goats needed to use the realm of Chikushido as a shortcut, Taka was forced to offer Kagore in exchange for safe passage. Kagore would then be raised and trained by [[Tengu Taro]]
