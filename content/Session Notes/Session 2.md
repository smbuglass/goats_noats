sapphire magistrate kitsuki needed us to either take a letter to the sapphire champion or defend the temple

decision was made for the party to travel to the Temple of the Clear Bell and have the proctor head to the saphire champion to get reinforcements

the party arrived at the chapel and saw it was currently under seige by a mix of peasants, bandits and chosen of fu leng

Under cover of night, [[Yagi Kagore|Kagore]] went in to meet up with the monks of the temple and attempt to coordinate a joint attack with them. The abbot, a former unicorn by the likes of him, agreed to muster some monks for the attack.

In the morning, when the agents of fu leng began their assault again, the monks and [[Yagi Kagore|Kagore]] opened the doors and attacked them. While they were distracted, [[Junko]], [[Yagi Setso|Setso]] and [[Yogo Tatsuya|Tatsuya]] brought up an attack from the rear.

The fight began to look quite dire as the three flanking party members were one after the other incapacitated by the ferocious Chosen of fu leng, though at the last moment Junko regrouped and put down the last Chosen samurai with the help of [[Yagi Kagore|Kagore]]

After the skirmish, the other half of the enemies retreated, no longer having the numerical advantage. 

The party had their wounds tended by the monks, and the Abbot spoke with [[Yagi Kagore|Kagore]] privately, entrusting the black scroll of fu leng into his care for his valor and respect of the temple.

Later the party met the Sapphire Champion on the road, and transferred the black scroll into their care. [[Junko]] and [[Yagi Kagore|Kagore]] were inducted into the [[Sapphire Magistrates]] for their valor in each putting down a Chosen of Fu Leng.
