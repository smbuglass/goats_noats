Our story begins in [[Hiezu]], a small town in the lands of the Goat, where exams for the newly founded [[Sapphire Magistrates]] are being held. Included among the entrants are two goat samurai, [[Yagi Setso]] and [[Yagi Kagore]], a black scorpion, [[Yogo Tatsuya]] and finally a single peasant entrant, [[Junko]].
# First Night 
On the first night, Junko, who lives in [[Hiezu]] tried to catch up on studying for the exam. Since she didn't have any kind of formal education, she knew she was going to need it.

[[Yagi Setso|Setso]] went out partying but quickly found the drab atmosphere of the nearby inn not to his tastes, as it was mainly full of other entrants, anxiously studying. Looking for something to liven his spirits, he shortly found the Path of Honor, a short obstacle coarse-like path up a nearby rugged hillside that samurai often race eachother up as a point of pride or to settle disputes. Setso joined in the fun and narrowly won.

[[Yogo Tatsuya|Tatsuya]] tried to shmooze with the proctor, [[Kitsuki Hong]] and made some headway but was largely ignored as they were quite busy with last minute preparations for the exams.

[[Yagi Kagore|Kagore]] excitedly explored the streets of [[Hiezu]], is it was his first time in a town this populated. He quickly found Setso, and also participated in a race at the Path of Honor, joining him as one of the night's victors.
# Written Tests
On the first morning of exams, the entrants met the exams proctors, [[Kitsuki Hong]] and [[Asahina Makoto]]. The exams began with three written tests, where the entrants were required to reflect on the following prompts:

---
*Following the rules and protecting the regulations is binding oneself without rope. Neglecting the written records with unrestrained ideas is falling into a deep pit.*

---
*“Consider the case where a samurai has, through no dishonorable or warlike intent or action, travelled 100 li (30 km) into foreign territory neither with permission of his unwitting host nor his liege lord. What must he do under the law of Rokugan?”*

---
*“A monk from a Fortunist Sect, a farmer with a heavy wagon, and a mounted samurai all reach the head of a narrow bridge simultaneously. In what order do they cross the bridge, and why?”*

---
The tests went largely without issue for the party, who all received satisfactory marks.
# Finding Your Arrow
The afternoon saw the entrants hunting for blunted arrows which were labeled with the contestants names and fired into [[Hiezu]]. Entrants had to find the arrows "within an acceptable time."

[[Yogo Tatsuya|Tatsuya]] communed with the air kami to ask where his arrow landed. In addition to finding he location of his arrow, he was given a warning about the elements being distressed by something to the east. An ill omen.

[[Junko]] was approached by a street urchin who had found her arrow, as well as that of an Ichiro entrant from the Badger clan. She thanked the child and paid him 1 zeni, telling him how to find the owner of the other arrow.

[[Yagi Setso|Setso]] took on a grid based approach, thoroughly combing the town for his arrow. He eventually found it, though with out much time to spare.

*scott doesn't fuckin remember how [[Yagi Kagore|Kagore]] searched for the arrow and if tommy would like that included here he should DM him.*
# Martial Exam
The second day began with a basic kata exam. Entrants were run through basic combat motions in order to prove sufficient control over themselves and their weapons. During Setso's examination, the test was interrupted by a [Yuki no Onna](https://l5r.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki_no_Onna), which threw the battered body of a sapphire magistrate into the ring and then attacked. 

[[Kitsuki Hong]] was buried under a tent during the initial attack, but [[Asahina Makoto]] wasn't present(suspicious?) 

After the yokai was defeated, [[Junko]] tried to help the injured magistrate but they died shortly thereafter, but not before entrusting an important message to her:
